\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for an elliptic curve multi-scalar multiplication by representing numbers in double-based number system (DBNS).
%As a method based on the representation is known to be one of the fastest algorithms up to date, DBNS is one of the tools used for reducing the computation time of a scalar multiplication.
Even though the DBNS-based scalar multiplication has a drawback of requiring a lot of memory
in which the worst case it might require to store almost as many pre-computation points as the bit-length of the scalar,
we propose a DBNS-based method that can reduce the memory consumption.
With the same number of pre-computation points, the computational time of our multi-scalar multiplication is smaller than
those of a sliding window method and a double-base chain representation related method.
In addition to our newly proposed DBNS-base algorithm which relies on greedy heuristic,
we also propose another algorithm that can optimize the computational time.
Our analysis shows that, when using the same number of pre-computation points, our optimal computational time is much smaller than the previous method.
