\section{Conclusion}

In literature, several works have been done to optimize and analyze the computational time of
the multi-scalar multiplication $mP_1 + nP_2$ when the precomputation points is in the form
$P_1, 3P_1, 5P_1, \dots, (2h + 1)P_1, P_2, 3P_2, 5P_2, \dots, (2h + 1)P_2$.
We show in this paper that those precomputation points are not necessarily the best choice for the operation.
Using precomputation points $P_1, 3^1P_1, 3^2P_1, \dots, 3^hP_1, P_2, 3^1P_2, 3^2P_2, \dots, 3^hP_2$,
we can improve the computation time for 0.55-1.53\%.
Our new algorithm is also faster than the tree-based approach using double-base chain representation.
The improvement range from 4.41-5.12\%.
