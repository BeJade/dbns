\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we analyzed the interleaving signed sliding window method.
We also propose a new interleaving DBNS algorithm which is mostly better than
interleaving signed sliding window method in terms of operation counts.
The improvement range from 0.55\%-1.53\%.
Our new algorithm also faster than the tree-based approach using double-base chain representation.
The improvement range from 4.41\%-5.12\%.
